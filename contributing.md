## Contributing
Thank you for taking the time to contribute your time to making this starter project come to life!

Just a few things to note:

- You can pick any tasks available in the roadmap.md file, no matter how small or large
- Try to commit any behavioral changes to tests as documented in the project roadmap.
- Try to prefer being dumb over clever, that is, where possible write code that is idiomatic and makes sense without requiring comments or explanations.
- We use the [Git Flow](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) model to make any updates to this codebase
- Try to keep packages as up to date as possible.

Good Luck!
